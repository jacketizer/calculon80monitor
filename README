Bootloader (BOOTLDR)
--------------------

The bootloader is the first program to be executed when the computer starts.
It's purpose is to test the memory where the Main Program will be loaded and
then copy the Main Program into RAM by doing the following:

  * Disable interrupts
  * Wait for reset line to stabilize
  * Test high RAM (0xE000-0xFFFF)
  * Copy Main Program from ROM (0x0100) to RAM (0xE000)
  * Run Main Program from RAM

The bootloader isn't allowed to utilize any RAM or devices other than what is
needed to test the memory and copy the Main Program. Due to this, the stack can
not be used.

Basic IO (BASICIO)
------------------

This is the hardware abstraction layer for all the computers devices.
