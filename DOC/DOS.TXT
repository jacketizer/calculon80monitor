STRUCTURE
---------

On "system tracks", .SYS files or embedded in assembly and put on ROM?
ROM version first as it enables development before file system is in place.
Then probably .SYS files as in MS-DOS and not the dedicated system tracks
approach used in CP/M.

CONFIG.SYS
----------

OS configuration.
